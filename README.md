## Purpose

Convert a Microsoft Word document (docx) to [Govspeak Markdown](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown), which is the format required to publish on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/).

This package is a personal project for learning purposes. It may never be finished and has no guarantees.

## Motivation and scope

Producers of [statistical publications](https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?content_store_document_type=statistics_published&order=updated-newest) might draft their reports in docx format. Publishers need to convert these to Govspeak Markdown so they can be uploaded to the Government's publishing platform. This can be time consuming to do manually and there is potential for error. There's a [Govspeak converter tool](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/), but there's some missing functionality.
